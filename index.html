      <h1>Sustainable Development Goals</h1>
      <p>
        The Sustainable Development Goals are the blueprint to achieve a better
        and more sustainable future for all. They address the global challenges
        we face, including poverty, inequality, climate change, environmental
        degradation, peace and justice.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is about better protecting the natural foundations of life and our
        planet everywhere and for everyone, and preserving people's
        opportunities to live in dignity and prosperity across generations.

          <h2>The World Health Organization (WHO)</h2>
          <p>
            The World Health Organization (WHO) has been leading the global
            effort to tackle COVID-19. The Strategic Preparedness and Response
            Plan, produced by WHO and partners, outlines the public health
            measures that countries should take to prepare for and respond to
            COVID-19.

          <h2>Goal</h2>
          <p>
            Patients get the care they need and frontline workers get essential
            supplies and information, and to accelerate research and development
            of a vaccine and treatments for all who need them.

          <h2>Vaccine</h2>
          <p>
            As we are experiencing now with COVID-19, pandemics are scary,
            life-changing and affect much more than just our health and daily
            lives. Vaccines protect against diseases that have the possibility
            to become pandemics, and by continuously vaccinating. We want to
            focus more about the population, and making sure that everyone get
            vaccinated.

        <h1>WHO</h1>
        <p>
          WHO, together with partners, also provides guidance and advice for
          people to look after their mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic
          — especially health workers, managers of health facilities, people who
          are looking after children, older adults, people in isolation and
          members of the public more generally.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pandemic is much more than a health crisis. It requires a
          whole-of-government and whole-of-society response, matching the
          resolve and sacrifice of frontline health workers.
