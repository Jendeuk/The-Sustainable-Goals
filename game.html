          <p>
            The goal in this game is to pick up trash from the ocean to keep our
            beaches and ocean trash free. You can play this with a group of
            friends, but if you're younger, make sure to have an adult always
            with you. You start by rolling the two dices, the person who got the
            least amount of the score added up by the two dices will have to do
            the challenge of picking up plastic. After you think you've picked
            up enough trashes, look at the table in the next section to see how
            many points you'll get for each type of item found. Every other
            players playing will otherwise get 2 point.

          <h1>Why play this game</h1>
          <p>
            Plastics are part of our daily life, but at the same time they are
            also a big part of our waste stream. Marine debris is a fact, either
            by floating in the water, washed up on our coasts or underwater.
            These marine debris results in big damages to the marine ecosystems.
            For instance, marine life can get trapped in plastic debris or being
            killed, as the fishes, turtles and other marine mammals often
            mistakenly consider them as food. To save the ocean water from
            trashes, means saving many lives. And that makes you a hero!
